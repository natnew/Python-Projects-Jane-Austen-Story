            "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\r\n",
            "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone\r\n",
            "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\r\n",
            "woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\r\n",
            "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\r\n",
            "were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\r\n",
            "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\r\n",
